# berth

berth is a Blazingly Fast™ CLI-focused alternative to the VSCode Dev Container Extension, letting you create development environments without touching repository code - written in Rust.

## What is `berth`
`berth` brings VSCode Dev Container's convenience to CLI editors like Helix by letting you create and enter interactive containers using a global config file. It makes it easy to mount projects into containers and add development tools, without needing to modify the source repository or have a Dockerfile available

`berth` is a work in progress and promises no backwards compatibility at this state. Currently supports Linux and has been tested on WSL2 with Docker Desktop.

## Installation

Requires:
- Rust and Cargo (Tested on v1.84.0)
- Docker and the Docker CLI

Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:ArchieAtkinson/berth.git`
2. Enter the repo directory with `cd berth`
3. Build and install with `cargo install --path .`

You can now access `berth` from your command line. 

## Usage

```
berth, A CLI to help create development environments without touching repository code

Usage: berth [OPTIONS] <ENVIRONMENT>

Arguments:
  <ENVIRONMENT>  The environment to be used

Options:
     --config-path <FILE>  Path to config file
     --cleanup             Deletes container on exit
     --build               Build/rebuild the environment instead of starting it
     --view                View environment definition after it has been parsed by berth
 -h, --help                Print help
```

To use `berth`, simply create a configuration file with an environment for your application and run `berth <ENV_NAME>`. If this is the first time using this environment, `berth` will build it before running it.

You can test a minimum example with:    
`berth --cleanup --config-path config_examples/basic.toml basic`    

Once in the container you can run `asciiquarium` to see a lovey ocean scene. 

Check the `config_examples` directory for example configuration files.

## Configuration

The configuration file is written in `TOML` and is used to define your environments.

By default `berth` will look for the configuration file at:
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/berth/config.toml`
- `$HOME/.config/berth/config.toml` 

 You can also pass in a configuration file with `--config-path` which will take precedent over the above.

Each environment is defined in a `environment` sub-table, with the name used to the reference the environment the name of the sub-table. In the above example that is "MyProjectDev".

| Option | Type | Description | Example |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `image` | String | The container image to use. Passed to `docker create`. This or the `dockerfile` field must be present. | `image = "alpine:edge"` |
| `dockerfile` | String | The path to a dockerfile, this will be build and passed to `docker create`. This or the `image` field must be present. | `dockerfile = "$HOME/dockerfile"` |
| `build_context` | String | The path of a build context directory used when building a provided `dockerfile` | `build_context = "/my/build/context"`
| `entry_cmd` | String|  The command that will be run in the container when the environment is started. Passed to `docker exec`. This is a required field. | `entry_cmd = ["/bin/bash"]` |
| `entry_options` | String Array | Options passed to `docker exec` for the `entry_cmd` | `entry_options = ["-it"]`|
| `cp_cmds`| String Array | A list of commands to copy files to or from the container. Use `CONTAINER`as a placeholder for the container name. Passed directly to `docker cp` | `cp_cmds = [" -L /home/my_script.sh CONTAINER:/home/init_script.sh"]`|
| `exec_cmds`| String Array | A list of additional commands that will be run in the container when it is created, useful for adding additional packages. Passed to `docker exec` | `exec_cmds = ["apt update -y", "apt install -y cowsay"]`|
| `exec_options` | String Array |  Docker CLI options passed to the `docker exec` for all `exec_cmds` | `exec_options = ["-u", "user"]`|
| `create_options` | String Array | Docker CLI options passed to `docker create` command. Note that `--name` is not allowed as that is provided by `berth`| `create_options = ["--privileged"]`|
| `presets` | String Array | The name(s) of preset(s) to merge into the environment, see below for more information | `presets = ["interactive", "working_dir_mount"]` |

Note all commands are run with the current working directory as the provided configuration file's directory.

The minimum configuration is:
```toml
[environment.MyProjectDev]
image = "alpine:edge"
entry_cmd = "/bin/ash"
```

### Presets

Presets enable you to define reusable environment fragments that can be merged into different environments. They take the same fields as an `environment` (apart from the `presets` field) and do not have any required fields. 

Below is an example of a `preset` and how they are used in an `environment`:
```toml
[preset.interactive]
create_options = ["-it"]
entry_options = ["-it"]

[environment.example]
image = "alpine:edge"
entry_cmd = "/bin/ash"
presets = ["interactive"]
```

This gives you an interactive `alpine` container. Try this config with:
```bash
berth --cleanup --config-path config_examples/simple_preset.toml example
```

An `environment` does not need to populate any of the required fields if they are provided by a `preset`.  

#### Merging

Single value fields, like `image`, are can only be present once across the original `environment` and all specified `presets`. Fields that take an array are merged non-destructively and are flattened into a single array. Some examples of these behaviors are below.

This example: 
```toml
[preset.preset1]
image = "image1"
entry_options = ["entry_option1"]
exec_options = ["exec_option1"]
create_options = ["create_option1"]

[preset.preset2]
entry_cmd = "init2"
entry_options = ["entry_option2"]
exec_options = ["exec_option2"]
create_options = ["create_option2"]

[environment.env]
presets = ["preset1", "preset2"]
```
Is allowed and is equivalent to:     
```toml
[environment.env]
image = "image1"
entry_cmd = "init2"
entry_options = ["entry_option1", "entry_option2"]
exec_options = ["exec_option1", "exec_option2"]
create_options = ["create_option2", "create_option2"]
```

While this example:
```toml
[preset.preset1]
image = "image1"

[preset.preset2]
image = "image2"

[environment.env]
entry_cmd = "cmd"
presets = ["preset1", "preset2"]
```
Is not, and will produce the following error:     
```
Error: configuration::preset::duplication

  × Duplicate Fields From Presets
   ╭─[example.toml:2:1]
 1 │ [preset.preset1]
 2 │ image = "image1"
   · ────────┬───────
   ·         ╰── instance 1
 3 │
 4 │ [preset.preset2]
 5 │ image = "image2"

   ·                      ╰── Preset(s) causing duplicate 'image' field

```


### Environment Variable Expansion Side Effects

The all `*_options` field will expand (local) environment variables. `berth` uses a hash of the entire environment configuration which is generated post expansion to create a unique identified to detect changes and find already created containers. This can be useful to having one environment used for many different containers. The primary use case of this is mounting working directory with `PWD` as it will create a new container for each unique working directory `berth` is ran in.

## Motivations

There were two mains motivations for me to make this tool. 

First was to move away from VSCode to use the CLI text editor Helix. However, a lot of my projects use containers to handle the dependencies and required tools. This has lead to relience on VSCode and its Dev Containers extension to be able to work on these projects. Not wanting to modify these containers to add my own personal tools I created `berth` to fill that niche while staying within the dev container workflow. I'm currently using every day for my work and found that is works better than I hoped.  

Second is wanting to learn Rust and this gave me a perfect excuse. 

## Possible Future Features

- Garbage collection for old containers
- Allow CLI options to be set in the configuration file
- Expand commands set (forcing rebuilds, deleting containers)

## Information for Nerds

### Container Naming

Containers names are split into three, separated by a `-`:     
`berth-Bar-a667d944e9480d0d`

The first part is simple, just `berth` to identify it was created by `berth`.

The second part, which is `Bar` in this example, is the name of the environment.

The third part is a hash of the environment configurations using `SipHash-1-3`, the default hasher Rust provides. This allows detecting changes and rebuilding containers if the configuration has changed. The hash is calculated after any additional parsing such as expansion of environment variables.

### Image Naming

If a dockerfile is used to provide the image, `berth` will build it and name it in a similar format as the container:     
`berth-test-71a2f882f9065141cbf75a92b2ef7217eb1ec4bb0f85a5cec919c6812e13b814`

With the images tag always `latest`.

A difference from the container naming convention is that the third part is a `sha256` hash of the entire dockerfile. This provides the same benefits as hashing the environment configuration, allowing `berth` to detect changes and rebuild if necessary. The image name is also added to the environment configuration, so will be also be represented in the container hash.
